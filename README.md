# Distro Tweak Scripts
Some tweaks for distros, like resolve emoji problems and distro specific problems

## General
Tweaks and fixes for all distros/DE
 - [Emojis not showing correctly][emoji-fix]:  
    Some of them appear in B&W instead of colored.

## POP_OS!
 - [ArcMenu installation fail][arcmenu-fix-popos]:  
    POP_OS! is a minimalist distro, it's a good thing, but may cause problems and some installation by lacking of dependencies, in this case, the GObject GnomeMenu library component.

[arcmenu-fix-popos]: /tweaks/pop-os/fix-arc-menu-install.sh
